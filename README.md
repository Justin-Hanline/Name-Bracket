# Name-Bracket
What it is: 30-Name Round Robin
The code opens a window where the ranks and voting are available.

To change what items are being voted on:
1) Open Names.py
2) Go to line 9 (where the list of names is declared) and change the names
3) Everything else should change automatically. If not, let me know so I can change it.

To run:
1) Open command prompt and change the directory to the folder where these files are being held (cd "FILE_DIRECTORY")
2) type "python BracketGUI.py"
Everything should compile accordingly
